  | [Patent Classifier](https://github.com/cdrc1103/PatentClassifier) | Multi-Label Patent Classification with Deep Neural Networks |2021| `TensorFlow`, `Transformers` |A comprehensive study to identify, implement and evaluate suitable approaches for the classification of patents using different neural network architectures like CNN, RNN, and Transformers. A domain-specific data set of 200.000 patent documents is used.
  | [Crowdedness Prediction](https://github.com/cdrc1103/CrowdednessPrediction) | Crowdedness Prediction in Public Transport Under Covid-19 |2020|`PyTorch`| During Covid-19 pandemic social distancing in public transport is an important matter to prevent spreading the virus. Thus, it would be beneficial to know when and where there are bottlenecks in the public transport network. Our goal is to reduce the capacity problem by predicting the crowdedness for a specified time interval with RNNs.
